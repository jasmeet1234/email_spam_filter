# Email Spam Filter Demonstration

ðŸ’Œ Welcome to the Email Spam Filter Demonstration! This project showcases a simple email classification system using the Streamlet framework and the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to input an email message and receive a classification indicating whether the email is spam (unwanted) or ham (legitimate).

## Features

- **User Interface:** An interactive interface where users can input email content.
- **Naive Bayes Algorithm:** The Naive Bayes algorithm is used to classify emails based on pre-trained data.
- **Streamlet Integration:** Streamlet is used for handling user input and displaying results.
- **Classification Result:** Users will be shown whether the email is classified as spam or ham, along with a confidence score.
- **Feedback Loop:** Users can provide feedback on the classification accuracy, aiding in continuous improvement.
- **Instructions:** Clear instructions are provided to guide users on how to use the demonstration.
- **Error Handling:** The system gracefully handles exceptions during the classification process.

## Limitations

- This demo is a simplified version and not as accurate as production-grade spam filters.
- Naive Bayes is effective but may not match the complexity of advanced models.
- Advanced features like whitelist/blacklist management are not included in this demonstration.

## Requirements
